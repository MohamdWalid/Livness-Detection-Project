# Problem definition and objectives 
•	User authentication for accurate biometric systems is becoming necessary in modern real-world applications. Authentication systems based on biometric identifiers such as faces and fingerprints are being applied in a variety of fields in preference over existing password input methods.

•	Face imaging or Face image  is the most widely used biometric identifier because the registration and authentication process is noncontact and concise, but there is a problem of forgery via photos and videos.

•	It is a technique that detects whether the face is real or fake by taking a real picture and dividing the color texture in order to capture certain characteristics of the pictures to know the real person or fake and then registration of the persons attendance after making sure that is real

•	The motive and the problem statement behind this project is that we want to combat face spoofing by rejecting the common methods of attacks  such as   printed photo attacks, cut photo attacks, and video relay attacks This is what it offers us CASIA-FASD Dataset  . because attempted attacks or facial spoofing are common in such a project , and also nowadays with the advancement of technology we need such things in companies or colleges or in schools as well, Because we may use this project to complete another part, which is the  face recognition to record the attendance of people, for example, if we want to use it in colleges, we may use it in the Lab places of the students so The student passes in front of the camera to record his attendance instead of printing attendance papers and the attendance papers pass over all students, or for example In companies, instead of using the old methods or fingerprints to attend, All you have to do is pass from  front of the camera to  verify, and thus we have solved another problem besides combating face Anti-Spoofing, which is a time savings.
